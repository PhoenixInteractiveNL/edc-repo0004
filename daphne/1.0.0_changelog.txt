Changes - 2nd April 2009
------------------------

v1.0.0
- Fixed OpenGL offset test, and added a check for the bottom row also.
- Fixed sound shutdown bug (possibly crash when shutting down daphne).
- Fixed laireuro driver so that overlay is displayed properly in OpenGL mode.
- Stats are now sent after a game has run, not before. This is because the delay in sending stats was throwing off one of the timers.
- Fixed a bunch of unit tests that weren't passing.
