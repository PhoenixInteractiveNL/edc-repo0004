This is my first release over the UltraHle leaked source code.

What´s new:
- Fixed 'romnames with spaces' bug. (Folders supported too).
- Eliminated very much redundant code (more speed).
- Some GUI corrections.
- Better support for WinXP Voodoo Drivers.
- Fixed some sound routines (more speed).

Future plans:
- More compatibility (of course).
- Add all SupraHle modifications and more (always is possible...).
- Zip support.
- Language support.
- Plug-in support (Advanced Options), not only plugins under the zilmar specs. I think to release better Audio and  Graphics plugins (with D3D and/or OpenGL support) under the own 'UltraHle specs'.
- Skins support :).
- and more...
