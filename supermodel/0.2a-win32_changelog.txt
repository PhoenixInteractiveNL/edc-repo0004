Changes - 24th September 2011
-----------------------------

    Version 0.2a
        - New, fully customizable input system.  Supports any combination of 
          keyboards, mice, and analog and digital controllers.  [Nik Henson]
        - Texture offsets.  Fixes models in 'Fighting Vipers 2', 'Virtual On',
          cars in the 'Scud Race' and 'Daytona USA 2' selection screens, etc.
        - Fixed a 2D palette bug that would cause black pixels to occasionally
          turn transparent.
        - Added all remaining ROM sets.  [krom]
        - Got some new games to boot: 'Spikeout', 'Ski Champ', 'Sega Bass 
          Fishing', 'Dirt Devils', etc.
        - Sound support.  Special thanks to ElSemi for contributing his SCSP
          emulator and Karl Stenerud for allowing us to use his 68K emulator.
        - Multi-threading support.  Sound and drive board emulation are off-
          loaded to separate threads, substantially enhancing performance. 
          [Nik Henson]
        - Z80 emulation based on code by Frank D. Cringle and YAZE-AG by 
          Andreas Gerlich.
        - Digital Sound Board (MPEG music) emulation courtesy of R. Belmont and
          the MPEG decoder library by Tomislav Uzelac.
        - Improved ROM loader.  It should no longer be as easily confused by
          combined ROM sets as long as unused files are removed.
        - Configuration file now supports more settings and allows game-
          specific customization.
        - Added light gun crosshairs ('The Lost World'), enabled by default in
          full screen mode and selectable by pressing Alt-I.
        - Drive board and force feedback emulation for 'Scud Race', 'Daytona
          USA 2', and 'Sega Rally 2'.  [Nik Henson]
        - Viewable display area properly clipped.  Ghost artifacts no longer
          appear in border regions when the resolution exceeds the display 
          area.
        - Changed gear shifting: added a dedicated neutral gear and sequential
          shifting.
        - Console-based debugger (not enabled by default, must be
          enabled during compile-time).  [Nik Henson]
        - Source code and Makefile cleanup.
