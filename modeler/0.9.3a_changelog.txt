Changes - 8th December 2001

Changes from 0.9.3
------------------

Linux
=====
- Removed some debug printing for Model 1 games

Win32
=====
- Relinked with static multithreaded MSVCRT for better compatibility
- Includes CVS SDL with support for 4 joypads
- Now includes the faster V60 core like 0.9.3 Linux and MacOS (damn
  misnamed files)
- Kaillera support for Outrunners

Common
======
- Rewritten memory handling system gives a speedup in all games
- 2 player support in Outrunners
- As a result of all the speedups, I've dropped the minimum requirement from
  450 to 350 MHz for x86 PCs.  Outrunners and other demanding games are now
  very playable (45+ FPS) without sound on my P2-400 test machine.
- V60 CPU core fixes from Luca Elia of MAMEdev.  We're unaware of any
  obvious things corrected by these, but hey :)

Known problems (do not waste time on the boards asking about these)
--------------
* Rad Mobile flashes "Motor Trouble" or similar.  To fix, hit Insert to enter
  the test menu, press Home to highlight "Game and System Setting", press
  Insert to enter that screen, then press 1 until Cabinet Type is
  highlighted.  Press space to change it to "upright", then press Insert.
  Press Home until "Quit" is highlighted, exit test mode, then press Esc to
  make sure the settings are saved to your harddisk.
* Star Wars Arcade shows an error on startup.
* Outrunners sound when you go off the road is annoying.
* Controls do not work if you change the cabinet type from the default.  This 
  also happens on the real PCB because 2 player cabinets have a different 
  input daughtercard than 4 player ones.  Thus, you must use the US ROM sets 
  to play GA2 or Spiderman with 4 players.  Also, you must not change the US
  sets to "2 player" in the test menu.
* Sound is not correct in Hard Dunk.
* The pitch (field for those who don't speak futbol) is not drawn properly
  in SVF.
