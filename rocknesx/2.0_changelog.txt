-------------------------

 Version 2.0 final

 - AUDIO, GUI: SERIOUS bug fixed in the sound setup: the soundcard information was
   being incorrectly stored. This fixes some odd errors on audio initialization.

   running with 3D Hardware support

   cases.

   switch (during the emulation)

   continuous play. Bug is fixed.
 - VIDEO: new multithreaded gfx engine: now the emulation is able to run at full speed
   even if very slow videocards. The gfx engine will try to render the maximum number of
   frames possible (60 fps is the maximum). This means auto frameskip support.
