===================
v0.6  April 17 2006
===================

1.  Added CPU Registers window to the Tools menu.  This window allows viewing / modifying of
    8085 CPU registers in addition to simple stop/step/run operations.  It is not intended as
    a full blown debugger, but rather as a tool to be used along with a debugger to be added
    later.

2.  Completed ReMem emulation support.  VirtualT emulates rev 4 of the ReMem firmware.  All 
    features of ReMem are emulated inclulding Rampac support.  See the ReMem documentation for
    operation of the ReMem emulation.

3.  Added Load and Save operations to the Memory Editor Window. 

4.  Added MSPLAN to the T200 ROM and support for running option ROMs from T200 emulation mode.

5.  Changed the name of this file from readme.txt to release.txt.
