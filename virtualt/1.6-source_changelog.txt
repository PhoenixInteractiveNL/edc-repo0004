====================
v1.6 April 24, 2014
====================

1.  Fixed issue with remote interface simulated keystokes where the keys wouldn't
    always be regconized.  There was a race condition between the remote thread
	and the simulation thread.

2.  Completed the 8085 relocating linker!!  This was the primary reason for this
    release in fact.  Many, many changes to get to this point.

3.  Modified the IDE with new tabs for selecting the file to edit.  The old tabs used
    the standard FLTK tab control and were really ugly, plus had an issue with tab
	width calculations with regard to mouse presses to select the tab.

4.  Updated GNUmakefile to auto-generate dependencies and use wildcard search for
    selecting source files vs. specifying everything manually.

5.  Added feature to FX80 printer emulation to perform auto word-wrap selectable via
    the printer setup page.

6.  Modified CPU speed indicator to show 2 decimal places precision for speeds less than
    10 MHz.

7.  Made the FX80 Virtual Paper display resizeable.

8.  MAJOR modifications to CPU Registers window to implement program tracing with 
    scrolling, configurable font sizes and trace depths, auto-redraw vs manual
    redraw button, saving of breakpoints and window position when VirtualT terminates,
    resizeable window, saving trace data to a file, keyboard shortcuts.
    
9.  Added saving and restoring of opened windows when VirtualT is shutdown and restarted.

10. Now reports error if REX / ReMem memory cannot be loaded / saved.

11. Updated REX emulation to support REX3 for PC8201 state machine changes.

12. Created a Watch Variables Widget and added it to the Memory Editor Window.  This
    will also be used in the IDE debugger.
    
13. Added options to Memory Editor Window to use black background with color coded text
    and the ability to set the font size.

14. Started converting the preferences file to use preference groups to help organize
    the growing list of entries in the file.

15. Completed the "-nogui" option under Linux and added console interface control.  This
    provides an identical interface to the existing socket / telnet control interface.

16. Added emulated NADSBox (minimal implementation so far) and controls in Peripheral
    Setup to connect it to the serial port.

17. Added TPDD Server (NADSBox) packet log viewer window to Tools menu.

18. Added support for NEC PC-8300 emulation.

19. Started adding support to Disassembler window to disassemble things other than the
    main ROM.
    
20. Added color syntax hilighting, Load and Save, and Find operations to Disassembler window.

21. Modified serial.c to map 75 baud = 57600 and 110 baud = 115200.
