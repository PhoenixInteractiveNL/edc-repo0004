===================
v0.8  May 11 2006
===================

1.  Added the beginnings of an Integrated Development Environment.  The IDE included a project
    manager that supports "Tree" browsing of source files and a project settings dialog for
    specifying assember and linker options.  Also has a multi-window edit capability using a
    very simple text editor.  The editor will be expanded in a future release and will also
    include features for source level debugging, such as display of breakpoints and current
    execution location.

2.  Added an 8085 assembler, but no linker.  The assembler gernerates ELF format .obj output 
    files for use with the linker to be released in a later version.  The assembler is 
    basically useless without the assembler, but is included in the project.

3.  Added the beginnings of the Help system, although no real help info available.

4.  Maybe other bug fixes but I have forgotten because I am writing this 1 year after release.
