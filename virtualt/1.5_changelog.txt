====================
v1.5  July 9th, 2011
====================

1.  Added REX memory module emulation.

2.  Added ability to set custome LCD / Bezel colors.

3.  Updated makefile to compile properly under Mac OSX.  The FLTK library must be built
    separately and installed (via 'make install') prior to compiling VirtualT

4.  Added new File Browse dialog boxes with nicer look and more features.

5.  Modified the directory structure organization under Mac OSX to be the same as the
    Linux and Windows versions:
    
        Working Dir
             |
             +--M10
             +--M100
             +--M102
             +--ROMs
            etc.
      
6.  Updated emulation timing control to provide more accurate timing to support sound
    generation routines.
    
7.  Added sound support under Windows.  This is still very early stage and needs work as
    the sound is "choppy".  This is caused by rapid changes to the sound that occur during
    the middle of a "sound buffer" being played.  The code needs to be updated to detect
    these changes and deal with already-queued buffers.
  
8.  Added mouse detection events to main window to allow point and click, double click, 
    and right-click actions.
   
9.  Reworked Assembler / IDE interface.  IDE doesn't seem to work under OSX yet.

10. Completed the Assembler and have about 90% of the linker done.  The assembler will
    actually geneate output files given a single input file.
    
11. Added Socket Interface configuration dialog box.

12. Added telnet interface mode to socket interface.

13. Added a shortcut to the socket interface to allow setting register values using a simple
    "a=4", "hl=12h" syntax.
    
14. Added detection of hex values via trailing 'H' or 'h' to socket interface.
