Changes - 23rd November 2001
----------------------------

4KB EEPROM needs to be selected for some games before you even attempt to use then.
If you realize a game isn't functioning appropriately, try to enable 4KB EEPROM.
Certain games like Perfect Dark, Yoshi Story, and others will not function correctly
without this.  If you select it once, you will not have to select it again.  The size
will be automatically determined based on the filesize of the EEPROM save image.  A
few other notes is that the emulator will be unplayable with games that utilize the
TLB heavily.  I have no TLB caching-type mechanisms employed.  Thus, GoldenEye,
Conker's Bad Fur Day, and a few others are unplayable (too slow).  I have a nasty
FPU bug which I haven't gotten around to fixing yet.  This makes Turok2, ExciteBike64,
and a few other games unplayable.  This is not a complete release, I don't have the
time to work on Apollo until after Christmas.  So I figured I would make one last
release before then.  Apollo still isn't technically public, but I swore to someone
I would release once I got those certain games working.  I honor my word.
