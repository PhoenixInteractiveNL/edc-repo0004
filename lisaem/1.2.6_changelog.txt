Changes - 13th December 2007
----------------------------

--- 1.2.6
fixed win32 rawbitmap issues, this should speed up the display
 quite a bit.  
Linux rawbitmaps don't work yet, just show a blank
 white display.

fixed bugs on skinless on OS X.  
Issue with wxBitmap, it needed
 to be filled in before using. Some update to wxWidgets changed
 the default from the default being white, to an alpha background
 causing the whole display to fail to update at all since the data inside the wxBitmap was invisible.

bug report:
 - libexpat was accidentally turned on in the OS X version of LisaEm, this is not needed by LisaEm's use of wxWidgets, it will be removed via  --without-expat in wxWidgets' configure script.
