Changes - 2nd January 2014
--------------------------

v1.1a
- Added back the game options that were removed in the previous version due to compilation issues (Cheats & options, dump texture cache, reload LUA script)
- Fixed texture replacement that was also removed.
- Diferent alpha filtering code that should improve the extra lines in some textures.
