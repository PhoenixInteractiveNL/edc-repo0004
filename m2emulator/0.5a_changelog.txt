Changes - 29th May 2007
-----------------------

v0.5a
This is a small bugfix release:
Fixed (hopefully at last) the analog wraparound bug.
Fixed wrong colour table translation in vcop madium and expert levels.

Added a couple of useful features:
Launch game from commandline (just add the driver name. ex: Emulator.exe stcc)
Auto-switch to fullscreen after game loading (the option is in the Video menu)
