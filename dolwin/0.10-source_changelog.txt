    Core : 0.10 has totally reanimated core. We rewrote whole interpreter and
    memory core. It is not perfect, but its fine to run some advanced software.

    User Interface : Dolwin has powerful file selector to load GC files. You
    can sort items in many ways, and set file filter for file extensions, 
    which you dont want to add in list. File can be  easily loaded by
    double-clicking on it. Selector will add new search directory itself, after
    succesful loading of supported files (DOL, ELF, GCM or GMP).

    Hardware : Since, we have some HLE in Dolwin, its now high-level emulator,
    but it can work in low-level hardware emulation mode. Dolwin is still able
    to run PONG ;) There are not many changes in hardware emulation, since 0.09.
    We just cleaned whole code, added DVD plugin and memory cards :)

    HLE : Currently Dolwin has some HLE support for Nintendo Dolphin OS. 
    MAP-files are required for high level emulation.
        Dolwin has built-in MAP-maker module, but you shouldnt rely on it, 
    because Dolphin OS has many versions, and MAP-maker can fail to find all 
    needed OS-calls. This release including only Zelda MAP-file. You can try
    to find others on Dolwin site (put new maps into Dolwin Data directory).
